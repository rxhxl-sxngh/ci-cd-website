    <p>
      I am an ambitious student with a passion for engineering and computing. I
      am on track to graduate from Texas A&M University in the spring of 2025
      with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and minors in Mathematics
      and Statistics. My favorite elements of computer science include human
      computer interaction, software development, and the pervasion of
      computing. <br /><br />
      My best skill, without a doubt, is how quick I am on the uptake. My
      general aptitude to pick up new information combined with my desire for
      learn from others makes me a very teachable individual who is able to
      perform in new situations. I love improving efficiency, whether that may
      be in my own productivity or my projects. <br /><br />
      Although I am fascinated by computers, I try not to spend all my time
      seated behind one. In my free time, I love to play sports especially
      basketball, read books, and analyze films.
