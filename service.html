    <div class="project-details">
      <p class="project-description">
        I worked alongside NFL Super Bowl MVP, Von Miller, to run an auction
        fundraiser for his charitable organization, Von's Vision, which gives
        the gift of sight to low-income students in the form of free eye care
        and glasses. In attendance, there were numerous NFL stars, including
        Aggie legends Mike Evans and Johnny Manziel. I had numerous
        responsibilities in order to keep the event running smoothly including
        leading the team of volunteers for the event, keeping track of bids
        worth tens of thousands of dollars, and entertaining patrons and
        attendees while the stars were getting interviewed and situated. I
        also helped with the setup and teardown of the event, which included
        setting up the auction items, setting up the tables and chairs, and
        cleaning up the venue after the event.

    <div class="project-details">
      <p class="project-description">
        Special Olympics Unified Programs bring together athletes with and
        without intellectual disabilities to train and compete on the same
        team. Throughout the year, Unified Partners participate in a variety
        of sports to improve physical fitness, sharpen skills, challenge the
        competition and have fun! I participate in this almost every semester,
        and it is always a blast. I have played basketball, soccer, and flag
        football with the athletes, and in the fall of 2022, the team I was
        assigned to for basketball happened to win the whole league. It was
        one of the most memorable moments of my life.

    <h2 class="project-title"><a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/">The Big Event</a></h2>
    <div class="project-details">
      <p class="project-description">
        Since its introduction in 1982, The Big Event has become the largest
        one-day, student-run service project in the nation. Each spring, tens
        of thousands of Texas A&M students come together to say “Thank You” to
        the residents of Bryan and College Station. For the past 37 years,
        Aggie students have participated in this annual event to show their
        appreciation to the surrounding community, completing service projects
        such as yard work, window washing, and painting for residents of the
        community. Although The Big Event has become the largest one-day,
        student-run service project in the nation, our message and our mission
        remains the same - to simply say “Thank You.”
