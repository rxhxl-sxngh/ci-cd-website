      Howdy! My name is Rahul Singh and I am an ambitious student with a
      passion for engineering and computing. I am on track to graduate from
      Texas A&M University in the spring of 2025 with a Bachelor of Science in
      Computer Science and minors in Mathematics and Statistics. My favorite
      elements of computer science include deep learning, human computer
      interaction, software development, and the pervasion of computing. I am also especially passionate about using my
      knowledge about technology to make my life easier, and this is one of my main motivations for my projects.
      <br /><br />
      My best skill, without a doubt, is how quick I am on the uptake. My
      general aptitude to pick up new information combined with my desire for
      learn from others makes me a very teachable individual who is able to
      perform in new situations. I love improving efficiency, whether that may
      be in my own productivity or my projects. <br /><br />
      Although I am fascinated by computers, I try not to spend all my time
      seated behind one. In my free time, I love to play sports especially
      basketball, read books, and analyze films. A recurring theme that I hold in high regard is the notion of making
      sacrifices as a means to accomplish one's aspirations; that is why two of my all time favorite movies are Whiplash
      and La La Land.
